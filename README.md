- **Booking History**: Users can view their past bookings and manage upcoming bookings.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators can manage rooms, view bookings, and manage users.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python Framework)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Basic frontend)
- **Libraries**: Django ORM, MySQL client, Bootstrap (optional for styling)

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/room-booking-system.git
cd room-booking-system
2. Set up a virtual environment
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If mysqlclient installation fails, you can use PyMySQL:

Update the DATABASES setting in settings.py:
python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'room_booking_system',
        'USER': 'root',  # your MySQL username
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',  # your MySQL password
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
5. Run database migrations

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
6. Create a superuser (optional)
To create an admin user to manage the system, run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create the admin user.

7. Run the development server
